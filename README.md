# Tictactoe minimax AI

This is a simple implementation of a minimax algorithm on a Tictactoe game in c++.

The game works in PVP, P vs AI and AI vs AI.

The AI will always pick the best possible move, and so it cannot be won against. But it can lead to draws.
In AI vs AI the games will also always be exactly the same, since the best moves won't change.

The game is played and displayed in the console, it doesn't need a particular library.
